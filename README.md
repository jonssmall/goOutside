A flawed but honest beginner's attempt to get Mongo, Express, React, and Node working together.
I don't know how to get Webpack's dev server to play nice with an Express API,
so you have to run webpack -watch, mongod, and npm start on separate tabs.
If you use Nodemon, you must configure it to ignore the /client React folder.
